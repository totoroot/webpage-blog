## Conventional Setup

<img data-src="assets/images/conventional-networking-setup-upscaled.png" width=77%>

<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">

This is a conventional setup like many of you might have at home. Nowadays in many cases the modem and router will be one box provided to you by your internet service provider.

Perhaps it's a FRITZ!Box with a fibre optic connector or a standard DSL/ADSL modem connected via a good ol' copper cable.

Quick question. How many of you have a static public IP at home?

Many people use dynamic DNS solutions like DuckDNS to forward traffic to their router and then forward individual ports to their servers or other devices.

</aside>

----

### Issues with Conventional Setup

- Dynamic DNS not the most reliable
- **Exposed port(s) on home network** üëÄ

<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">

This setup is somewhat insecure as you would typically have have an open port on a device in your home network.

That might not be a problem for many years, until it suddenly becomes one, as that port could randomly become a target of some bad actor.

## Improved setup

<img data-src="assets/images/proposed-networking-setup-upscaled.png" width=77%>

----

### Issues with Conventional Setup

- WireGuard can be difficult to setup and manage
  - Key distribution for all nodes
  - NAT Traversal and Firewall Exceptions

---

## Proposed Setup

- Small rented VPS with public IP
- WireGuard data plane
- Tailscale clients (most platforms)
- Headscale coordination server on VPS
- Reverse proxy on VPS
