After reading [Jeff Geerling's recent blog post](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/raspberry-pi-kvms-compared-tinypilot-and-pi-kvm-v3) and watching the [associated video](https://youtu.be/TIrkEr2AeDY) I just backed the [Pi-KVM project](https://pikvm.org/).

It seems like the perfect extension of my homelab since I've recently got myself a Raspberry Ri 4 with 4GB.

The Pi-KVM is a fully Open Source IP-KVM with [IPMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface) for 150 USD (now even comes with a nice metal case).

A while ago I decided to no longer back anything on Kickstarter.
