## Short answer

A 2 GHz dual-core processor and 4 GB of system memory should be enough to run many Linux distributions smoothly.

## Ubuntu as a choice

That being said, Ubuntu uses GNOME as a DE (desktop environment) and more feature-rich desktop environments like GNOME and KDE can use quite a bit of memory for displaying animations and such, so with your hardware, it might not run all that smoothly.

Snap and the snap store, that are included with Ubuntu, also use a lot of memory, so with just 4 GB available, I'd suggest you take a look at other Linux distributions.

## Other options

More minimal desktop environments exist, such as XFCE or LXQt, so if you want to stick to a -buntu variant, I recommend you give Xubuntu a try.

For other “lightweight” distributions, take a look at this Wikipedia article. There are many great options available, but as a starter, stick to one that says “Desktop” in the purpose column.

## Hardware upgrades

If you have an option to upgrade your hardware, a good starting point would be to get an SSD. SATA SSDs have got cheap and are easily available in most parts of the world.

The mentioned 25 GB of drive space are not a lot and in case it is still an HDD, any modern system will definitely benefit from an upgrade to an SSD, as it will significantly reduce boot time as well as load times of applications.

Your system will therefore feel a lot “smoother”, no matter which Linux distribution you decide on.
