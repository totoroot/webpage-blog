# Grazer Linuxtage 2024

I'm holding two talks at this year's [Grazer Linuxtage](https://www.linuxtage.at/en/).

> **Note**: The talk is given at [HS i1](https://hoersaalinfo.tugraz.at/lecture_halls.php?id=2206) at [TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/) [Campus Inffeldgasse](https://www.tugraz.at/tu-graz/universitaet/gebaeude-der-tu-graz/#c69303). The lecture hall fits 117 people and I estimated that about 80 people were in attendance, as quite a bit more than half of the seats were taken. I was very happy about that.

## Declarative Homelab on NixOS ❄️

Since the slides were generated with the presentation framework [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) I wanted to share the [HTML version of these slides](https://blog.thym.at/declarative-homelab-on-nixos).
You can access the exported PDF version of the slides [here](https://blog.thym.at/glt24/declarative-homelab-on-nixos.pdf).

## Securely access your home server from anywhere'

Since the slides were generated with the presentation framework [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) I wanted to share the [HTML version of these slides](https://blog.thym.at/homelab-networking).
You can access the exported PDF version of the slides [here](https://blog.thym.at/glt24/homelab-networking.pdf).

You can go through the slides with the arrow keys or use the spacebar to look through them in order. If you're looking for a particular slide press the "M" key to get a content menu.

I will perhaps fix some mistakes if I notice any, so changes may be made.

<!-- You can watch a recording of this talk on [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/v/glt23-379-alles-nix-reproduzierbar-deklarativ-zuverlssig). A livestream was available during the event as well. -->

If you have any questions regarding my talk or want to give personal feedback feel free to reach out to me via Email or [DeltaChat](https://delta.chat/en/) at chat\[at\]thym.at or through the options listed [here](https://blog.thym.at/about/).

Cheers,\
Matthias
