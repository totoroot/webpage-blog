I held a talk at this year's [Grazer Linuxtage](https://www.linuxtage.at/en/) titled "Gotta Collect 'Em All - Metrics Easily Visualised". The talk was given over [BigBlueButton](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/) with slides exported to PDF. You can access the exported PDFs [here](https://blog.thym.at/glt21/gotta-collect-em-all.pdf).

Since the slides were generated with the presentation framework [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) I wanted to share the [HTML version of these slides](https://blog.thym.at/glt21) too.

You can go through the slides with the arrow keys or use the spacebar to looko through them in order. If you're looking for a particular slide press the "M" key to get a content menu. I will perhaps fix some mistakes if I notice any.

I will probably give some more information about my experiences speaking at #GLT21 in a separate blog post soon.

If you have any questions regarding my talk or want to give personal feedback feel free to reach out to me via Email or [DeltaChat](https://delta.chat/en/) at chat\[at\]thym.at.

Cheers,
Matthias
