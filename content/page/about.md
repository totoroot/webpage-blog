Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matthias Thym aka totoroot and this here is my personal blog.

If you were instead looking for my professional resume or want to know more about my educational background as well as my professional experiences and skills, let me redirect you to [my resume](https://matthias.thym.at). It is also available [in German](https://matthias.thym.at/de).

This blog will be home to my random thoughts I want to share and here is where I will [waffle](https://britishslang.co.uk/slang/waffle) about all kinds of things I'm interested in like software ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) in particular) or linguistics and language learning.

I will not limit myself to any one topic and will instead allow my thoughts to flow freely and use this blog as my personal brain dump.

This about section will be worked over once I've proven to myself, that I will stick to actually using this blog and not abandon it after just two posts like last time.
